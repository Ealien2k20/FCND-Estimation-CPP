## Write Up: Building an Estimator

This Writeup.md considers the rubric points individually and describes how I addressed each rubric point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. To provide a Writeup that includes all the rubric points and how I addressed each one.  

The current Writeup.md (markdown) file serves the purpose of addressing how I have dealt with the various tasks.

### Implement Estimator

#### 1. Determine the standard deviation of the measurement noise of both GPS X data and Accelerometer X data.


#### 2. Implement a better rate gyro attitude integration scheme in the UpdateFromIMU() function.

#### 3. Implement all of the elements of the prediction step for the estimator.

#### 4. Implement the magnetometer update.

#### 5. Implement the GPS update.


### Flight Evaluation

#### 1. Meet the performance criteria of each step.

#### 2. De-tune your controller to successfully fly the final desired box trajectory with your estimator and realistic sensors.
